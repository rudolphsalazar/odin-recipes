# odin-recipes
This is my first project for the TOD course that will take me to launch my career as a Frontend developer. 

This project is a simple, semantic html recipe collection featuring classic dishes from around the world. Each recipe includes a descriptive introduction, a structured ingredient list adn step by step cooking instructions.

So far, I have learned to download and install a VM on my windows to smoothly work on a Linux environment (Xubuntu distribution). I learned to set up git and create my gitlab account (creating repositories, cloning them onto my local machine, get an SSH key, adding, comiiting and pushing code to github etc). This was an incredible step for me given that it showed how the magic works between coding and internet presence.

Then, I learned folder structures, bash command lines, html basics and here we are, more motivated than ever in my life. Thank you, TOD team. You're the best!
