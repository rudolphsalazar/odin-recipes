<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Sancocho Colombiano is a hearty, traditional Colombian stew that brings families together around the table. It’s a rustic dish featuring a rich, savory broth simmered with a mix of meats like chicken, beef, or pork, alongside starchy vegetables such as potatoes, yuca, plantains, and corn on the cob.
  </p>
  <p>
    Flavored with herbs, garlic, onion, and cilantro, this comforting soup is often enjoyed with a side of white rice and avocado. Each region of Colombia has its variation, but the essence remains the same: a soulful, slow-cooked dish that celebrates home cooking and cultural heritage.
