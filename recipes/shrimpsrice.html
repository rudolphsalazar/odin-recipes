    <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This shrimp and rice recipe is a vibrant, one-pan meal that brings together juicy, sautéed shrimp with fluffy, seasoned rice for a comforting and flavorful dish. It starts with onions, garlic, and bell peppers gently sautéed in olive oil, creating a fragrant base. The rice is simmered in a savory blend of broth and spices, absorbing layers of flavor as it cooks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tender shrimp are added toward the end, just long enough to cook through and soak up the seasoning without becoming rubbery. Finished with a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkle of fresh herbs, this dish is quick enough for weeknights but elegant enough for entertaining.
